# MS Redirector
Google chrome extension to redirect from localized MS content to en-us content.

Inspired by https://github.com/AirLancer/ffs_msdn_in_english but using Google's (new) declarativeNetRequest API and chrome.storage.sync to ensure that your settings are synchronized across your devices.
